# radscanner

You've somehow landed on my pretty-much-alpha version of a Minecraft server scanner.
This is essentially my rust learning Project.

# Usage
Configure config.toml to your liking.

Put the list of IPs into your configured `input_file` (seperated by a newline)

## Compiling manually
```
cargo build --release
./target/release/radscanner
```
or
```
cargo run
```
## Using binary
just ./radscanner, I'm not gonna explain that, you should know how to do that lol
## Docker
make your own and submit a pull request, I'm too dumb :)
